NEWS FROM THE 2ND OF DECEMBER 2019

In the branch master, in the "kicad_part" there is only the FR4_proto project. After testing the PCB thanks to VNA, it appears that 
the freqeuncy response is not the good one. The shape of the curve is really good, but S21 attenuation is high (between 5 and 6 dB),
and the central frequency is not the good one (1.8 GHz instead of 1.9 GHz).

The tested FR4_proto PCB is from PCBWay. The same one is being
currently manufactured at my school and should be finished by this week. Tests and comparison will follow.  


2 others filters PCB are arriving today from PCB way. 
They can be seen on developpement branch as FR4_proto2 and resonnator_LC (or bandpass_resonator_LC).
As a thought, it may be needed to move on better PCB material. I mean, more adapted to HF signals.
FR4 is good (and manufacturing is cheap), but not for HF, as it is a very lossy material at these frequencies.
RO5880 or RO4003 are much more adapted to HF stuff. But PCB manufacturing is expensive when using these 2.
